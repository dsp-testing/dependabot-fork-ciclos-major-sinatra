      These weeks will be dedicated to preparing you for the ‘312, 225 or 167’, covering sections of the route and climbs.
      The challenging nature of the week, with the opportunity to complete up to three 100+ mile rides to explore the
      whole 312 route mean this will be great preparation for any long sportive, or indeed any endurance event!
